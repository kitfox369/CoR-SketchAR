# CoR-SketchAR
CoR-SketchAR creates an environment for crowd simulation by recognizing color and shape of sketch drawn by simple color markers. The technology for recognizing shapes and colors was don through OpenCV, and "[OpenCV For Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/opencv-for-unity-21088)" was used to use OpenCV lib. In addition, an RVO algorithm was used to use crowd simulation. The code [here](https://github.com/snape/RVO2-CS) was used for RVO written in C#. If you want simulation actuate, you have to include that libraries in the links.
